1. writing `\toWork` will return a list of the next trains from home to work
   - will return the next _3_ trains
   - with delays (if there are any)
   - with ETA
   - with stations
2. `\toHome` will do the same
3. adding a number x e.g `\toWork 5` will return the trains in x hours
4. adding time units will return trains within these units of time

TODO: change output message time format
TODO: add an option to config HOME and WORK
